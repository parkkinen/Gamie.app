# Gamie, app for Android
Repository for the Exercises and Projects

Project

Our aim is to create an application where the users can browse different upcoming and already released games.
The users can set their own preferences on games to get recommendations based on them.

The application will be card based so the users can browse the games based on the cover arts.
